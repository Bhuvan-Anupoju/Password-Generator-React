# 🔐Password Generator

#### 🔰overview
- This is a dynamic and customizable Password Generator application built using React. It allows users to generate secure, randomized passwords based on custom criteria such as length and character composition. Whether you're building passwords for accounts, tools, or services, this app gives you full control over how strong or simple you want your password to be.

- Users can choose to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols to tailor the password generation process. The app supports password lengths between 6 and 18 characters, making it suitable for most use cases. Once the password is generated, users can easily copy it to the clipboard with a single click for quick usage.

- Under the hood, the app makes use of modern React Hooks to manage state, access DOM nodes, and optimize performance:
